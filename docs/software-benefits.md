# Airport Software

This software has been created for the use in airports to solve a number of problems that may occur without it. The following are a few explanations about the problems being solved, the benefits this software can bring and some risks associated with the software.

### Problem the software is solving

------------------------------------

This software is designed to allow the safe operation of the airport services. Without it the airport would not have any way to check or change the maximum capacity. It would not be able to instruct a plane to land only if the airport has space, and it would not be able to instruct the plane to take off while it is at the airport.

-----------------------------------

### What it can do for you

-----------------------------------

It will be able to do a number of things for you such as :

- Allowing the capacity of the airport to be checked
- Allowing the capacity of the airport to be changed when necessary
- Instructing planes to land
- Making sure planes only land when there is space
- Checking if a plane is at the airport
- Instructing planes to take off
  
These features are to ensure that :

- The airport does not land more planes that it has space for
- The airport can change its allowed capacity to allow for changes
- Planes can be told to land safely
- Air Traffic Controllers can check where a plane is
- Planes can be instructed to take off at the right times
