# Airport Software

This software has been created for the use in airports to solve a number of problems that may occur without it. The following are a few explanations about the problems being solved, the benefits this software can bring and some risks associated with the software.

------------------------------------

### Problem the software is solving

------------------------------------

This software is designed to allow the safe operation of the airport services.

**Capacity** - Without it the airport would not have any way to track the number of planes an airport can hold. With the software an air traffic controller can make sure planes are not instructed to land.

**Air Traffic Control Support** - The software has a feature allowing for air traffic controllers to check if there is space available and then instruct planes to land. It can also allow them to check if a plane is at the airport so it can be instructed to take off.

-----------------------------------

### What it can do for you

-----------------------------------

It will be able to do a number of things for you such as :

- Allowing the capacity of the airport to be defined
- Allowing the capacity of the airport to be changed when necessary
- Allow Air Traffic Controllers to instruct planes to land
- Allow Air Traffic Controllers to make sure planes only land when there is space
- Checking if a plane is at the airport
- Allow Air Traffic Controllers to instruct planes to take off
  
These features are to ensure that :

- The airport does not land more planes that it has space for
- The airport can change its allowed capacity to allow for changes
- Planes can be told to land safely
- Air Traffic Controllers can check where a plane is
- Planes can be instructed to take off at the right times

---------------------------------

### Risks associated with the software

---------------------------------

There are also a number of risks associated with this software:

**Possible landing and takeoff collisions** - The software doesn't have a way to tell if a plane is still on the runway before a plane is instructed to land. This could lead to collisions if the runway still has a plane on it or if two planes are instructed to take off simultaneously.

**Air traffic controller mistakes** - There is always the factor of human error and if an air traffic controller where to input something wrong then this could confuse the system. For example if a plane was input as already having landed and then requested to land it would not be allowed to as it is shown as already being at the airport.

---------------------------------

### Conclusion

---------------------------------

In conclusion the software provided a number of necessary operations for the safe running of an airport. Trying to solve problems with capacity and help air traffic controllers to do their job. It is however still recommended to use this alongside other airport softwares to allow for the safe and complete operation of an airport.
